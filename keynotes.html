                        Consumer-Grade Fabrication and Its Potential to Revolutionize Accessibility
                    </h2>

                    <h3 class="h5" style="clear:both">Abstract</h3>
                    <p>With the increasing power and flexibility of technologies available to consumers, we are seeing a revolution in how assistive technology (AT) is being created and by whom. This talk will highlight the potential of these technologies for people with disabilities, as well as the challenges that end users face in leveraging them effectively to address AT issues.</p>

                        Engineering Automations: From a Human Factor Perspective to Design, Implementation and Validation Challenges
                    </h2>

                    <h3 class="h5" style="clear:both">Abstract</h3>
                    <p>While engineers have always been working hard at producing systems automating operator’s tasks, the Human Factors community has been studying hazards of automation and potential dangers that might arise from their deployment, especially in critical contexts. The presentation will highlight the apparent contradictions between interactive systems and automation, starting from the MABA-MABA (Fitts 1951) oversimplification (which divides the world of actions between what Machines Are Better at and what Men Are Better at). I will then highlight the challenges to face in order to design, implement and validate interactive systems that exhibit autonomous behaviors. I will demonstrate that these challenges take place at every level of interactive systems architecture and require pluri-disciplinary skills to address them. Illustrative examples will be taken from multiple applications domains (such as aircraft cockpits, air traffic management, satellite ground segments and standard desktop applications).</p>

                    <p>Philippe Palanque is professor in Computer Science at the University Toulouse 3 and is head of the ICS (Interactive Critical Systems) research group at IRIT. Since the early 90's his research focus is on interactive systems engineering proposing notations, methods and tools to integrate multiple properties such as usability, dependability, resilience and more recently user experience. These contributions have been developed together with industrial partners from various domains such as civil aviation, air traffic management and satellite ground segments. He is now involved in the specification of future interactive cockpits and in the modelling of operational states of civil aircraft (with direct support from and close collaboration with Airbus). He has been working in the area of automation for more than ten years. He was a member of the SESAR Higher Automation Levels in Aviation network of excellence and paper co-chair of ATACCS (Application and Theory of Automation in Command and Control Systems) 2015 conference. He is the secretary of the IFIP Working group 13.5 on Resilience, Reliability, Safety and Human Error in System Development and is steering committee chair of the CHI conference series at ACM SIGCHI. He is a member of the CHI academy and chair of IFIP Technical Committee on Human-Computer Interaction (TC13). He edited and co-edited more than twenty books or conference proceedings including the "Handbook on Formal Methods in Human-Computer Interaction" published by Springer in 2017.</p>
